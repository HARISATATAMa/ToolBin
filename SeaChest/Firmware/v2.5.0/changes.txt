                     Fixed a bug where we could accidentally clear some stored
                     identify data from the device structure. Fixed continuing
                     on when there was a permission denied error opening a

v2.4.0  14-Jun-2017  1_15_0 libraries adds bug fix malformed command line
                     should exit with code = 1; added detection of parallel ATA
                     and SCSI speeds; temperature data on ATA now uses the
                     values from the SCT status log or device statistics log.
                     Bug fix where the "-d all" was not filtering out csmi
                     drives like it is supposed to causing duplicate drives to

                     Data ASC, ASCQ definitions from SPC5. Adds --Scan (or -S,
                     note the capital S) aggressive system scan.
