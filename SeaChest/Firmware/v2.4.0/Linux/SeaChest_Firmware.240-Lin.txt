===============================================================================
Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest_Firmware diagnostic software.

SeaChest_Firmware is a comprehensive command line tool that can be used to
update firmware, also known as microcode, on Seagate disk drives (this includes
Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie).

Seagate products are run by firmware.  Having the latest firmware can improve
performance and or reliability of your product.  Seagate recommends applying
new firmware to enhance the performance and or reliability of your drive.  Like
any software, firmware is improved over time and problems are also fixed. 
Every drive family has a couple of firmware releases during the life of the
product.  Please check in regularly to determine if new firmware is available
for your drive.

SeaChest_Firmware allows for both single drive and sequential batch mode
firmware download.

NOTE: SeaChest_Firmware may not be fully functional on non-Seagate drives.

This User Guide file contains important information about SeaChest_Firmware.
Please read this entire file before using this software.

If this is your drive, you should always keep a current backup of your
important data.

Be very careful using SeaChest_Firmware. Power failure during a firmware
download will cause data loss. Never apply firmware to a drive unless you are
certain that the firmware data file is specifically prepared for your drive.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

Usage
=====
        SeaChest_Firmware [-d <sg_device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples
========
        SeaChest_Firmware --scan
        SeaChest_Firmware -d /dev/sg2 -i
        SeaChest_Firmware -d /dev/sg2 --fwdlInfo
        SeaChest_Firmware -d /dev/sg2 --downloadFW fwfilename
        SeaChest_Firmware -d /dev/sg2 --fwdlConfig configfile.cfs

Utility arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
                /dev/sg? assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
                numbers. If your device is not listed on a scan immediately
                after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     sd             - show /dev/sd? device handles
                     sgtosd         - show the sd and sg device handle mapping
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the sg device handle (target drive) on which to perform an
                operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for
                information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example: -d /dev/sg5

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add --usbChildInfo
                to display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --fwdlInfo
                Use this option to show the firmware download support
                information for a drive.

        --downloadFW [fwfilename]    (Seagate Only)
                Download firmware to a Seagate storage product. Use only
                Seagate authorized firmware data files which are designated for
                the specific model drive. Improper use of this option may harm
                a device and or its data. You may specify the path if the
                firmware data file is in a different location. This option will
                use segmented download by default. Use the --downloadMode
                option to specify a different download mode.

        --downloadMode [full | segmented | deferred]    (Seagate Only)
                Use this command along with the --downloadFW option to set the
                firmware download mode.

                Supported Modes:
                     full      - Performs a download in one large transfer to
                                 the device.
                     segmented - Downloads the firmware in multiple segments to
                                 the device. (Most compatible)
                     deferred  - Performs a segmented download to the device,
                                 but does not activate the new firmware until a
                                 power cycle or activate command is sent. Drives
                                 with this feature are not common. See
                                 --activateFW.

                Note: See the --modelMatch and --onlyFW utility options which
                may assist in creating commands to update multiple similar
                drives.

        --activateFW     (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to issue the command to activate code that was
                sent to the drive using a deferred download command. This will
                immediately activate the new code on the drive. You can use
                this along with a --downloadFW and --downloadMode to
                automatically issue the activate command after the deferred
                download has completed.

        --fwdlConfig [config file]      (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to specify a configuration file to perform an
                update based on a firmware match on multiple drives or a single
                drive in the system.  You may specify the path if the file is
                in a different location. Configuration files consist of model
                numbers, previous compatible firmware and the appropriate
                matching new firmware.  Configuration files may be written to
                support multiple models at a time.  See the section below
                "Firmware Configuration Files" for more information on this
                subject.

        --fwdlDryRun
                Use this option to compare a given config file to the drives in
                a system without performing a firmware update. This can be used
                to check if any drives in the system require an update.

        --fwdlSegSize [segment size in 512B blocks]     (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to specify a segment size in 512B blocks to use
                for a segmented or deferred download. This option will not
                affect an immediate download (full buffer at once). The default
                segment size used is 64. Larger segment sizes may be faster,
                however they may also be incompatible with controllers or
                drivers in the system. Smaller values are more likely to be
                compatible, but also slower. Use this option if the default
                used by the tool is not working correctly for firmware updates.

Utility Options
===============
        -h, --help
                Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)

        -v [0-4], --verbose [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
                Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are
                0 - quiet,
                1 - default
                2 - command descriptions
                3 - command descriptions and values
                4 - command descriptions, values, and data buffers.

                Example: -v 3 or --verbose 3

        -q, --quiet
                Run SeaChest in quiet mode. This is the same as -v0
                or --verbose 0

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest version and copyright information & exit

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.

        --newFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to skip drives matching the provided firmware
                revision. This option will only do an exact match. This option
                should be used to skip performing an update if a drive already
                has this firmware revision loaded.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

Tool Usage Hints
================
See Sample Output examples below.

First, run the SeaChest -s option to determine what /dev/sg? device handle
assignment lines up to your disk drive. This option will also show you other
details about the drive including the current firmware revision. Like this:

Vendor     Handle       Model Number       Serial Number     FwRev
ATA        /dev/sg0     ST94813AS          3AA043KP          3.03
SEAGATE    /dev/sg1     ST1000NM0011       ZAA15VAS          SN03

All utility arguments will require you to identify the specific drive by
providing the sg device handle (-d, --device).
For example, SeaChest_Firmware -d /dev/sg1 --shortDST poll

You may combine multiple tests with a single command line.  For example,
SeaChest_Firmware -d /dev/sg0 -i --smartCheck runs both identify and SMART.

Multiple device handles can be given by adding -d /dev/sg# for each additional
handle.  Devices are processed in sequential order.  For example,
SeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg0 -d /dev/sg3 -i runs identify on these two devices.

Caution: All device handles may be specified.  However, great care should be
taken to fully anticipate the consequences of running a command on all storage
devices in a system.  For example, a command to erase data on all drives could
be catastrophic or exactly what you want. The shortcut to select all devices is
-d all.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  Along with the
designation for all devices, you can narrow the tasks to specific types of
drives by using the --onlySeagate, --modelMatch and --onlyFW filters.

Tests which alter the firmware or erase user data on the drive are limited to
Seagate-only products which include Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie.

Tests which take a very long time to complete or erase all user data on the
drive will require a longer command line argument than indicated in the --help
output to the screen.  This approach is taken to eliminate the possibility of
accidental data loss or the commitment of long test times. The longer command
arguments are similar to -I-understand-this-command-will-take-a-long-time or
-I-understand-this-command-will-erase-all-data.

Advanced SAS installations may use dual ports.  These are listed as Port 0 and
Port 1 on the device information report. When both ports are active, each one
may have a unique /dev/sg designation.  The scan option may indicate that there
are two drives in the system with the same serial number.  Dual port
installations will also report two different Worldwide Numbers (WWN).

============================
Firmware Configuration Files
============================
There are two types of SeaChest_Firmware configuration (config) files:
encrypted CFS and plain text CFG.

Seagate-prepared configuration files are encrypted and carry the file extension
CFS.  Seagate does not decrypt or disclose the contents of its CFS files.

Alternatively, you may prepare your own plain text configuration files which
must use the file extension CFG.  SeaChest_Firmware configuration files are
simple text with multiple lines. Each line defines a model and previous
firmware match up to a new firmware data file.  The structure of each line is
this:

  fullModelNumber;$FWREV$oldFwVersion;fwDataFile;(optional)$FWREV$newFwVersion

No spaces, the first $FWREV$ and all three semi-colons (;) are mandatory.

Note: The full model number is the ELECTRONIC version.  The label shows a
shorter version which may not include all of the necessary digits.  When you
run SeaChest -s or --scan the output will display the full electronic model
number.  For example the label may show ST4000DX001 but the full model is
actually ST4000DX001-1CE168.  You must use the full model numbers as given by
the --scan command.

The --scan commmand also shows the current firmware, such as CC46 or SN03 or
0002 or 0001SDM7.  There are several possible variations.  This corresponds to
the old firmware version.  You must precede the old firmware version with these
exact characters $FWREV$, like $FWREV$0001SDM7.

Seagate is the only authorized source for a firmware data file. The file name
and or other documentation should provide the new firmware version for the file.

The last section of the data line is optional, the new firmware version.  If
you include this information correctly, then SeaChest_Firmware may give a
message stating that the drive already has the new firmware.  If you omit the
new firmware details then you must still end the text string with a semi-colon
(;).

For example, this is a four-line configuration file for three different models
and three different firmware data files (not all model numbers have the longer
electronic version):

ST4000DX001-1CE168;$FWREV$CC42;BarracudaXT-CC44.LOD;$FWREV$CC44
ST4000DX001-1CE168;$FWREV$CC43;BarracudaXT-CC44.LOD;$FWREV$CC44
ST120FP0021;$FWREV$B770;SSD-B775.BIN;
ST4000NM0043;$FWREV$0004;Constellation3TB-0005.lod;$FWREV$0005

Remember, no spaces, the first $FWREV$ and all three semi-colons (;) are
mandatory.

Caution:  Firmware download configuration files assume you have knowledge about
which models are compatible with the associated firmware files.  If you are
unsure about the compatibility then you should NOT attempt to download the
firmware to the drive.  Never apply firmware to a drive unless you are certain
that the firmware data file is specifically prepared for your drive. Be very
careful using SeaChest_Firmware. Power failure during a firmware download will
cause data loss. Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

Finally, you may optionally add a hash check calculation on the firmware data
file to the SeaChest_Firmware configuration file.  Simply, run a MD5
calculation on the file and then add "@MD5=61b33014f2d2a4f9553f6ef64fb82e31"
(substituting your calculation) immediately following the file name, before the
semi-colon (;).  For example:

ST4000DX001-1CE168;$FWREV$CC43;BarracudaXT-CC44.LOD@MD5=61b33014f2d2a4f9553f6ef64fb82e31;$FWREV$CC44

SeaChest_Firmware will compare its own MD5 calculation to the value in the
configuration file and if they do not match then the procedure will abort.

===================
General Usage Hints
===================
Remember that Linux file names and command line arguments are cAsE SeNsiTiVe.

Display a file listing with the Linux command: ls -lah

The tool will require root privileges to run using either sudo or su commands.
Also, verify that the tool has executable rights.

A dot slash is a dot followed immediately by a forward slash (./). It is used
in Linux to execute a compiled program in the current directory when it is not
a built-in command or found in your path.

For example, ./SeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST poll
or, sudo ./SeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST poll

Shut down the files system and remove the power with the command:
poweroff

See previous screen history with the key combination:
Shift+PgUp or Shift+PgDn

Save a log file by redirecting the screen output to a text file by adding space
&>test.log at the end of your command line. Choose your own file name. To
append the screen output to an existing log file use >>test.log.

To save a log and display results at the conclusion of the tests, you can use
the "tee" command. Tee command writes to the STDOUT and to a file.
For example,
SeaChest --echoCommandLine -d /dev/sg0 -i --smartCheck | tee -a mySeaChestLog.txt

Display a log or text file with the Linux "less" command: less myfile.log
Press the letter q to quit displaying the file.  Similarly, you can easily
read the Seagate License agreement by piping the output to the less
command with SeaChest --license |less

Display a list of sg (SCSI generic) devices with the command:
cat /sys/class/scsi_generic/sg*/device/model
or
ls /dev/sg*

sg devices include the following interfaces: SATA, USB, SCSI (SCSI, SAS and FC)

Add the command word 'time' on the same command line before the SeaChest
command to see how much time it takes to run a test.
For example, time ./SeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST poll

When drives are not detected by SeaChest
----------------------------------------
The problem is that the sg driver isn't loaded on the system on boot.  You can
test if it is loaded by doing "ls /dev/sg*" and see if anything shows up. If
nothing shows up then the SG driver is missing (which is required by SeaChest
to issue commands).

You need to do "modprobe sg" as root to load the sg module (since it wasn't
compiled into the kernel), then you will get sg devices that we can scan and
find. Once you run the modprobe command and sg is successfully loaded, then you
can re-run "ls /dev/sg*" and see SG device nodes. SeaChest tools should then be
able to find devices once again.

About SeaChest Command Line Diagnostics
=======================================
Seagate offers both graphical user interface (GUI) and command line interface
(CLI) diagnostic tools for our storage devices.  SeaTools for Windows and
SeaTools Bootable for end users are the two most popular GUI tools.  These
tools support 15 languages.

SeaChest diagnostics are command line utilities which are available for expert
users.  These command line tools assume the user is knowledgeable about running
software from the operating system command prompt.  CLI tools are in the
English language only and use "command line arguments" to define the various
tasks and specific devices.  SeaChest diagnostics are available for both Linux
and Windows environments.

Linux versions of SeaChest tools are available as stand alone 32 or 64-bit
executables you can copy to your own system.  Windows OS versions of SeaChest
diagnostics are installed through a typical setup wizard and can be removed via
the Control Panel.

In addition, Seagate offers a tool to build a bootable USB SeaChest flash drive
which boots to a 32-bit Linux command prompt.  This is a Windows executable
file which formats a USB Flash drive you provide.  It copies over all the files
needed to use it as a bootable device for the SeaChest diagnostic software.
All data on the USB Flash drive will be erased so be sure to protect any
valuable files.

Technical Support for SeaChest drive utilities is not available.  If you have
the time to send us some feedback about this software, especially if you notice
something we should fix or improve, we would greatly appreciate hearing from
you.  To report your comments and suggestions, please use this email
seaboard@seagate.com.  Please let us know the name and version of the tool you
are using.

SeaChest drive utilities support SATA, SAS and USB interface devices.

SeaChest Basics - Contains the most important tests and tools.

Other SeaChest "break out" utilities are available and listed below which offer
more in-depth functionality in specific areas. These are:

SeaChest Configure - Tools to control various settings on the drives are
brought together into this one tool.  Typical commands, for example, include
Write Cache and Read Lookahead Cache enable or disable.

SeaChest Erase - The focus is on data erasure.  There are many different
choices for erasing data from simple boot track erase to full cryptographic
erasure (when supported).  Be sure to back up important data before using this
tool.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  This tool only works on
Seagate drives.

SeaChest Firmware - Seagate products are run by firmware.  Having the latest
firmware can improve performance and or reliability of your product.  Seagate
recommends applying new firmware to enhance the performance and or reliability
of your drive.  Most products may see one or two firmware updates within the
early life of the product.

SeaChest GenericTests - Read Tests are the original disk drive diagnostic which
is to just read every sector on the drive, sequentially.  This tool offers
several common read tests which can be defined by either time or range.  In
addition, the Long Generic test has the ability to repair problem sectors,
possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

SeaChest Info - Historical generic activity logs (like total bytes written and
power on hours) and performance logs (like temperature) are available for
analytical review.  Identification and inquiry data stored on the drive is also
provided.  A view of SMART and device statistics is available when supported by
the drive.

SeaChest PowerChoice - Seagate disk drives offer a multitude of options to
manage power.  This tool manipulates the various power modes.

SeaChest Security - Various settings are available on modern Seagate disk
drives which may be locked and unlocked.  These settings may interact with the
operating systems and systems BIOS.  Options also include cryptographic erase
for Self-Encrypting Drives (SED).

SeaChest SMART - This tool provides a closer look at the collected SMART
attributes data.  SMART stands for Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology.  Short Drive Self Test is included as one of the standard SMART
commands. In addition, the DST & Clean test has the ability to repair problem
sectors, possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (c) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented
by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than
an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application
with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the
Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the
Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object
code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility
programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but
excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),
then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

* a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure
that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
meaningful, or

* b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms
of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License.

* b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as
a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* d) Do one of the following:
  o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and
under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application
with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for
conveying Corresponding Source.
  o 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library
already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that is
interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

* e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only
to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a
modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking
the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use
option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the
terms of this License.

* b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
