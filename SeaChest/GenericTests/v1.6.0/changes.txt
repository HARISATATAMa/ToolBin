v0.0.1  06-May-2015  Initial ReadTests release.  Added Short and Long Generic
                     sequential read tests. Added Random and Butterfly read
                     tests.  Added sector repair on Long and user defined
                     generic read tests.

v0.0.3  16-Oct-2015  1_7_0 libraries.  Added enhanced version information.
                     Added -sat12byte to increase compatibility.  Added
                     --SATInfo to compare ATA vs SCSI identification
                     differences.
v1.0.0  02-May-2016  1_9_1 libraries.  Added new verbosity level. Added
                     --onlySeagate restriction.  Added --modelMatch and

v1.0.1  19-May-2016  1_9_2 libraries fixed scan information from ATAPI devices.
                     Fixed a bug where we could accidentally clear some stored
                     identify data from the device structure. Fixed continuing
                     on when there was a permission denied error opening a
                     drive.
v1.0.2  15-Jun-2016  1_9_3 libraries fixed issues with ATA secure erase
                     commands. Fixed bugs with --modelMatch and --onlyFW
                     filters.
v1.1.0  06-Jul-2016  1_10_0 libraries add --forceATA and --forceSCSI.
v1.1.1  14-Jul-2016  1_10_1 libraries adds SMART and power management
                     functions, format polling, endianess detection, buffer
                     size fixes, SAS device statistics, Win32 IOCTL
                     pass-through fix on Win8 and higher. Added support for
                     maxLBA keyword.
v1.2.0  01-Sep-2016  1_11_1 libraries updates to various printed message,
                     minor bug fixes. Fixed --SATInfo command.

                     and --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only).
v1.3.0  10-Oct-2016  1_11_4 libraries updates. Support for multiple devices.
v1.3.0  25-Oct-2016  1_11_5 libraries updates improved LaCie  detection, adds
                     SAT Vendor ID, SAT Product ID, and SAT Product Revision to
                     the -i --SATInfo output.
v1.3.1  27-Oct-2016  1_11_6 libraries updates WWN detection.  Added
                     --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
v1.3.1  03-Nov-2016  1_11_7 libraries fixed issue with SAS EPC power mode
                     settings.
v1.3.1  13-Dec-2016  1_11_10 libraries fixes a problem when using maxLBA without
                     the corresponding command range option, SAS power mode
                     setting, and Sanitize erase patterns.
v1.5.0  23-Feb-2017  1_13_0 libraries adds support for SAS 12.0Gb/s and
                     22.5Gb/s physical bus speeds, support for double buffered
                     passthrough IOCTLs. Add --hideLBACounter, --diameterTest,
                     --diameterTestRange. Random Range scaling has less biasing.
v1.5.0  06-Mar-2017  1_13_2 libraries adds Enhanced device information output
                     for SAS features. --userGenericStart now able to use timed
                     options.

v1.6.0  14-Jun-2017  1_15_0 libraries adds bug fix malformed command line
                     should exit with code = 1; added detection of parallel ATA
                     and SCSI speeds; temperature data on ATA now uses the
                     values from the SCT status log or device statistics log.
                     Adds the child drive matching options --childModelMatch,
                     --childOnlyFW, and --childNewFW.  Bug fix user generic
                     test start LBA gets reset when a defect is encountered.
