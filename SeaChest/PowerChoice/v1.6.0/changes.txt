SeaChest_PowerChoice is branched off from SeaChest Basics v1.0.3.

v0.0.1  14-Apr-2015  Intitial PowerChoice release.
v0.0.2  12-Aug-2015  Added --testUnitReady. Improved device discovery.
                     Corrections to verbose output.
v0.0.3  28-Aug-2015  Improved device compatibility.
v0.0.4  22-Sep-2015  Added --showPowerConsumption and --setPowerConsumption,
                     both are SAS only.
v0.0.4  16-Oct-2015  1_7_0 libraries.  Added enhanced version information.
                     Added -sat12byte to increase compatibility.  Added
                     --SATInfo to compare ATA vs SCSI identification
                     differences.
v0.0.6  26-Jan-2016  1_8_1 libraries.  Added --EPCfeature for SATA.
v1.0.0  02-May-2016  1_9_1 libraries.  Added new verbosity level. Added
                     --onlySeagate restriction.  Added --modelMatch and
                     --onlyFW filters.
v1.0.2  19-May-2016  1_9_2 libraries fixed scan information from ATAPI devices.
                     Fixed a bug where we could accidentally clear some stored
                     identify data from the device structure. Fixed continuing
                     on when there was a permission denied error opening a
                     drive. Fixed --checkPowerMode always returning "active" on
                     SAT interfaces (SATA over SAS). Fixed --transitionPower
                     always failing (It was  trying an incompatible value).
v1.0.3  15-Jun-2016  1_9_3 libraries fixed issues with ATA secure erase
                     commands. Fixed bugs with --modelMatch and --onlyFW
                     filters.
v1.2.0  06-Jul-2016  1_10_0 libraries add --forceATA and --forceSCSI.  Added
                     --showEPCSettings, --showAPMLevel, and --setAPMLevel.
v1.2.1  14-Jul-2016  1_10_1 libraries adds SMART and power management
                     functions, format polling, endianess detection, buffer
                     size fixes, SAS device statistics, Win32 IOCTL
                     pass-through fix on Win8 and higher. Added --disableAPM.
v1.3.0  01-Sep-2016  1_11_1 libraries updates to various printed message,
                     minor bug fixes. Fixed --SATInfo command.
v1.3.0  21-Sep-2016  1_11_2 libraries updates adds --forceATADMA, --forceATAPIO
                     and --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only).
v1.4.0  10-Oct-2016  1_11_4 libraries updates. Support for multiple devices.
v1.4.0  25-Oct-2016  1_11_5 libraries updates improved LaCie  detection, adds
                     SAT Vendor ID, SAT Product ID, and SAT Product Revision to
                     the -i --SATInfo output.
v1.4.1  27-Oct-2016  1_11_6 libraries updates WWN detection.  Added
                     --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
v1.4.2  03-Nov-2016  1_11_7 libraries fixed issue with SAS EPC power mode
                     settings.
v1.4.2  13-Dec-2016  1_11_10 libraries fixes a problem when using maxLBA without
                     the corresponding command range option, SAS power mode
                     setting, and Sanitize erase patterns.
v1.5.0  23-Feb-2017  1_13_0 libraries adds support for SAS 12.0Gb/s and
                     22.5Gb/s physical bus speeds, support for double buffered
                     passthrough IOCTLs. EPCfeature now supports SAS.
v1.5.0  06-Mar-2017  1_13_2 libraries adds Enhanced device information output
                     for SAS features.
v1.6.0  14-Jun-2017  1_15_0 libraries adds bug fix malformed command line
                     should exit with code = 1; added detection of parallel ATA
                     and SCSI speeds; temperature data on ATA now uses the
                     values from the SCT status log or device statistics log.
                     Adds the child drive matching options --childModelMatch,
                     --childOnlyFW, and --childNewFW.
