                     adds SAS (not SATA) FastFormat for Features Supported
                     section,  --deviceInfo now gives Low Current Spinup
                     status. Adds  --firmwareSlot/--fwBufferID, adds
                     --fwdlSegSize, adds --getTelemetry,  adds
                     --telemetryDataArea, adds showSupportedFormats, removes
                     --formatUnit. Adds several new commands in support of NVMe
                     format: --nvmFormat, --nvmFmtSecErase, --nvmFmtMS,
                     --nvmFmtNSID, --nvmFmtPI, --nvmFmtPIL, --nvmFmtMetadataSet.
v1.0.0  10-Jun-2019  1_19_23 libraries added SNTL (SCSI to NVMe translator),
                     updated software SAT translator to use dataset management
                     XL command, fixes for issuing vendor unique commands under
                     Windows, improved fast format support detection, and
                     refactored verbose output for NVMe commands.
v1.1.0  21-Nov-2019  1_20_5 libraries. Added new exit code 9 = Need Elevated
