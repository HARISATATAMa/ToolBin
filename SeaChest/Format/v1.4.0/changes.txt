---------------------------------

v0.0.1  23-May-2017  1_14_3 libraries.  SeaChest_FormatUnit initial beta
                     test release.  Branched from SeaChest_Erase v1.4.0.
v0.0.2  14-Jun-2017  1_15_0 libraries adds bug fix malformed command line
                     should exit with code = 1; added detection of parallel ATA
                     and SCSI speeds; temperature data on ATA now uses the
                     values from the SCT status log or device statistics log.
                     Bug fix where the "-d all" was not filtering out csmi
                     drives like it is supposed to causing duplicate drives to
                     show up.  Adds the child drive matching options
                     --childModelMatch, --childOnlyFW, and --childNewFW.
v1.0.0  14-Jul-2017  1_16_1 libraries adds support for ATA drives that have the
                     Sense Data Reporting feature enabled, changes to how we
                     interpret the completion status from the drive, new Sense
                     Data ASC, ASCQ definitions from SPC5. Adds --Scan (or -S,
                     note the capital S) aggressive system scan.
v1.0.0  27-Jul-2017  1_16_2 libraries enhances Seagate brand detection.
v1.0.0  19-Sep-2017  1_16_4 libraries fixes SCSI "--progress format", added
                     reading remanufacture time for SAS when the drive reports
                     a time, fixed SAS --abortDST.
v1.0.0  25-Sep-2017  1_17_0 libraries adds improved SATA device discovery on
                     SAS adapters, added NVMe read, write & Flush commands.
v1.1.0  10-Oct-2017  1_17_1 libraries adds Better handling of NVMe as a SCSI
                     device, SAT library strings, and fixes to Read-Buffer
                     error history (ISL). Updated copyright notice, invalid
                     command line options now only display an error instead of
                     long help. Added --setSectorSize moved from
                     SeaChest_Configure. Name change from SeaChest_FormatUnit
                     to SeaChest_Format.
v1.1.1  12-Oct-2017  1_17_3 libraries improves Fast-Format compatibility on SAS.
v1.2.0  26-Oct-2017  1_17_5 libraries fixes SATA drive discovery behind HBAs
                     that don't show as SATA and don't support the SAT VPD
                     page; added Automatic fallback to 12byte CDBs during
                     initial device discovery;  integrated fixes for SAS
                     firmware download and fixes for SAS LongDST time
                     calculation; added detection of TCG Pyrite and Opalite
                     drives. Removed --defaultFormat since that is now the
                     default behavior until other flags are added.
v1.2.0  31-Oct-2017  1_17_6 libraries adds ATA Security compatibility with SATL
                     on some LSI adapters, corrects firmware download issue
                     under Windows 10 API.
v1.2.0  02-Nov-2017  1_17_7 libraries fixes Long DST time on SCSI/SAS products.
v1.2.0  19-Apr-2018  1_18_0 libraries improves device detection of CD-ROM and
                     USB flash drives, support for early 90's PATA drives that
                     don't support LBA mode, bug fix where the last digit of
                     the SCSI Unit Serial Number was being dropped, additional
                     logic for deferred download completion status. --scan
                     --onlySeagate for just Seagate drives in a large system,
                     Long Drive Self Test Time in the -i output, write protect
                     status has been added for SCSI and NVMe in the -i output,
                     IDD enhancements for SAS, IDD enhancements to allow
                     captive mode on SATA, added USB Hacks to better support
                     some odd-ball USB devices and prevent crashes and improve
                     performance for some operations on them by issuing test
                     unit ready commands when something fails during device
                     discovery, automatic fall back to SAT 10 byte commands
                     during device discovery to help work with some USB

                     Data log and Device statistics logs page 0 to check the
                     list of supported pages; fixed a bug in the loop used to
                     read mode pages for -i information on SAS; IDD SAS
                     improvements; fixed a bug in DST & Clean with ATA drives
                     behind SCSI controllers. Fix for --modelMatch that have
                     spaces in the name. Added additional information to the
                     banner and -V data to show support levels. Add general
                     support for NVMe and NVMe specific identify data to "-i"
                     command.

                     adds SAS (not SATA) FastFormat for Features Supported
                     section,  --deviceInfo now gives Low Current Spinup
                     status. Adds --showSupportedFormats, removes
                     --showSupportedSectorSizes. Adds several new commands in
                     support of NVMe format: --nvmFormat, --nvmFmtSecErase,
                     --nvmFmtMS, --nvmFmtNSID, --nvmFmtPI, --nvmFmtPIL,
                     --nvmFmtMetadataSet.
